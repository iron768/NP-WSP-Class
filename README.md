# NP-WSP-Class
My work from class

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repo is intended for my spring 2024 New Paltz Web Server Programming Class.

## Computer science experience
I have been teaching myself Java since middle school to create server sided mods (plugins) for Minecraft. By the time my highschool started to offer computer science courses I was already fairly fluent in Java so they were fairly easy. I got my associates degree in liberal arts and science at Rockland Community College and during my time there I took several computer science courses and interned for a computer science role. Next semester will be my last and I just need to take a few more upper division credits and the projects course. I have written several (hundred?) plugins for Minecraft servers and networks. The biggest project with plugin development was a network I worked on. I wrote the framework to create minigame plugins, our moderation tools, and anticheat. I also helped design a caching system for one of our plugins that was causing the whole server to slow to a crawl. To prepare for ‘Assembly and Computer Architecture’ I studied C and x86 assembly and wrote a very small x86 based kernel.

## Goals for this class
I have some experience with web development, but not with a focus on applications. My friends have been running a company to design 3D interactive websites using three.js and React. Although I have been able to help contribute a bit, I haven’t been able to contribute as much as I wanted to originally. I consider web development to be one of my weaker topics so I am hoping to better understand web development from this course. Some of the tools/frameworks/libraries mentioned in the syllabus I have worked with directly are React, MongoDB, and git. I have also used javascript/typescript before and I am excited to hear that we are using typescript as I prefer it to typescript. I am not a huge fan of dynamically typed languages but I understand their purpose and usage. I am hoping to become a better web developer to become a bigger help to my friend’s web development company.
